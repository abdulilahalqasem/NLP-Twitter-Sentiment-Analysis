# Project Title: Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Description:

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It aims to classify tweets into two categories: positive and negative sentiments. The project encompasses several key steps:

### 1. Data Preparation:

- Importing necessary libraries for data analysis.
- Loading a Twitter dataset from a remote source.
- Data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Providing insights into the dataset's information, including the number of non-null entries, data types, and summary statistics.
- Visualizing data with heatmaps, histograms, and count plots.
- Creating a 'length' column for tweets' character length.
  
### 3. Text Data Cleaning:

- Removing punctuation and stopwords to prepare the text data for analysis.
  
### 4. Feature Extraction:

- Transforming text data into a numeric representation using Count Vectorization.
  
### 5. Model Building:

- Utilizing a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict tweet sentiments.
- Evaluating the model's performance through confusion matrices and classification reports.


  
**This project serves as a valuable example of NLP techniques applied to social media data for sentiment analysis. It can be extended for various applications, including social media monitoring, brand sentiment analysis, and customer feedback analysis.**
